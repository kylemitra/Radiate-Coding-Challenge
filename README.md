# Radiate-Coding-Challenge

## Instructions
Random.org generates high-quality random numbers using several radios. These radios capture atmospheric noise, which is primarily created by lightning discharges in thunderstorms. (Who knew 3.5 million lightning flashes occur daily?!) While we’re not quite in gambling or crypto yet, we hope you find this challenge interesting!

Your task is to write a function that uses the Random.org HTTP API to create an RGB image that measures 120 by 120 pixels, where each pixel is a random RGB color. BMP, PNG, or JPG images are fine. Use whichever language you’d prefer.

NOTE: Random.org limits IP addresses to a specific daily bit allowance. Make sure you read the guidelines, or you risk being temporarily banned!

Push your code and generated image to a newly created GitHub repo that is publicly accessible. Include any tests you may have written, and be sure to specify any dependencies. You have up to three hours to complete this challenge. Send me an email when you have finished.
